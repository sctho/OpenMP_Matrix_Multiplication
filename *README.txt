To run sequential program, compile and add an argument of which matrix size you want to run:
'T' for 5x2, 2x3 matrix multiplication
'A' for 50x20, 20x25 matrix multiplication
'B' for 500x200, 200x250 matrix multiplication
'C' for 5000x2000, 2000x2500 matrix multiplication
'D' for 50000x20000, 20000x25000 matrix multiplication

To run OpenMP, do same, add first argument, but also add a second argument: number of threads.
